# âœ¨ Django and Tailwind CSS

![Django and Tailwind CSS](./django-tailwindcss.png)

A simple setup for using **Tailwind CSS** inside **Django** project.

I have written a short blog article on how to setup Tailwind CSS into Django project. You can read it [here](https://ashminbhujel.com.np/django-and-tailwind-css).

Run the following command from the root directory (Directory where `package.json` file is) to generate the output CSS file called `style.css` inside `static/css/` directory.

```bash
npm run tailwindcss
```

You may need to change directory name inside `package.json` file if you create project directory named other than `my_project/`.

For Django we can use the usual commands.
